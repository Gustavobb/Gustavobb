Passionate about computer graphics, web 3.0 and innovation. I have experience in building innovative solutions using spatial computing, digital twins and machine learning with the newest devices in the market like Hololens, Magic Leap and Oculus. Besides that, I am experienced in 3d and point cloud data manipulation, shaders and multithreading processes. I also build games using Unity/Unreal/Godot.
